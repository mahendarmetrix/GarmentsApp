# GarmentsApp
The first screen shows a list of garment names and buttons to order the list by alphabetical order or by creation date/time.
A “+” button at the top right corner presents the second screen as a modal view.
The second screen allows saving a new garment in persistent memory, using the core date . Tapping the “Save” button closes the modal view and returns to the first screen with the list. The list then shows the newly added garment.
